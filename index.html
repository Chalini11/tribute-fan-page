    <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left:10%; padding-right:10%;">Arguably among India's finest T20 batsmen, Suresh Raina stormed into the international scene as a teenage prodigy during the Greg Chappell regime. Typical left-hander's elegance, power game and a fine temperament were the hallmark of Raina the batsman and he exhibited it beautifully during his ODI debut in 2005.Raina was the first Indian player to hold a century in all three formats of the game and although red-ball cricket wasn't his cup of tea, his contributions in the other formats were valuable to Indian cricket.
        He was my favourite player from childhood, his gentlemanship during the game and his energy were reasons he earned loyal fans from all over the world.

        Raina was the backbone of <a href="second.html" target="_blank">Chennai Super Kings' success</a>. His dashing left-hand style of play at No. 3 gave CSK the luxury to attack at will with a lot of firepower left down the order. The fact that he is currently the highest run-getter in the history of IPL (4985 runs before start of IPL 12) explains the magnanimity of Raina's contribution to the side and he is aptly nicknamed \"Chinna Thala\" by the CSK fans. The lofted straight drive (or hitting in the V) is a shot fans savour to watch as he audaciously plays without fear in a tournament like IPL. He recorded his highest-score in IPL - 100 not out against Kings XI Punjab in 2013 in Chennai, but his blitzkrieg (87 runs off just 25 balls) against KXIP in Qualifier 2 in 2015 standouts amongst all of his IPL performances.
